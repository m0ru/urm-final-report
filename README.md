# Build 

build the report via: 

```sh
pandoc --filter pandoc-citeproc main.md -o export.pdf
```

the `references.json` can be generated using e.g. [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).

there's a shell script that automates the build (`build.sh`). of course, that will only work if pandoc and pandoc-citeproc are installed.

pandoc installation guides are [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html). it should just be in `brew`, `apt`, `npm`, $insert_your_package_manager_here. you'll also need pdflatex installed to build the pdf â€“ however, you can just use an editor with markdown preview to write the thing or also generate html. furhtermore, the citations need pandoc-citeproc. In Windows you can also install the [linux-subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

alex really likes [Typora](https://typora.io). it gets out of the way, is pretty, and works without installing anything else (as far as i can tell).
